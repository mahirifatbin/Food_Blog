                <p class="heading">Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until the
                    onion has softened
                    and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking and stirring
                    until the onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more.</p>

                <p class="heading">Use this marinade for economical steaks – it will make the flesh more tender and add
                    flavour. Do not use this for expensive, prime grade beef steaks!It’s actually easy to make marinades
                    that infuse flavour into steaks.It’s actually easy to make marinades that infuse flavour into

                <h3 class="heading">Chicken Corn Soup</h3>
                <p class="heading">You can either just added shredded or diced cooked chicken to this soup. (A
                    rotisserie chicken would come in handy here, or I often use leftovers from my baked chicken breasts
                    recipe.) . Or, you are welcome to cook the raw chicken from scratch in the soup itself.</p>
